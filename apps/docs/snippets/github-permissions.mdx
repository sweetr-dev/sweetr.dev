Our GitHub app asks for permission for:

- Read: <Tooltip tip="Used to enable features like teams, people directory and allow teammates to login to your workspace.">members</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="Used to name your workspace.">metadata</Tooltip>.

- Read and write: <Tooltip tip="Read: Used on insights | Write: Used in automations, to post comments to pull requests.">pull requests</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="Write: Used in automations, to add commit checks to pull requests.">commit status</Tooltip>.

These permissions are necessary to sync metadata from GitHub to our database and provide service to you.
