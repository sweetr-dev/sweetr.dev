Digests can be sent monthly, weekly, or daily. Digests are team scoped, and must be enabled individually for each team.

## Metrics Digest

The metrics digest includes a summary of metrics found in [Team Insights](/features/team).

- Average Pull Request Size
- Average Cycle Time
  - Time to First Review
  - Time to Approve
  - Time to Merge

Enabling this digest should help teams understand their flow, and areas for improvement. It helps with accountability and removes the hurdle of having to manually check the metrics in the Sweetr dashboard.
