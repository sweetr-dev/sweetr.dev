## Size

The pull request size is calculated based on the amount of lines changed.

<PrSize color="#69DB7C" size="Tiny" label="< 20 lines changed." />
<PrSize color="#69DB7C" size="Small" label="20~100 lines changed." />
<PrSize color="#A6A7AB" size="Medium" label="100~250 lines changed." />
<PrSize color="#ff8787" size="Large" label="250~500 lines changed." />
<PrSize color="#ff8787" size="Huge" label="> 500 lines changed." />
