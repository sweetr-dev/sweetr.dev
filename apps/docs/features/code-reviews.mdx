## Demo

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/code-reviews.png" />
</Frame>

## Indicators

Each code review has an indicator for whether it was the Pull Request's first review.

<PrBadge color="#a6a7ab" type="first-to-review" />

The indicator can also change color depending on time elapsed between the Pull Request being "ready" and the review timestamp.

<ColorBadge color="#51cf66" label="< 2 hours." />
<ColorBadge color="#a6a7ab" label="> 2 hours." marginBottom={20} />

<Accordion title="What ready means">
The timestamp used for being "ready" is calculated based on what is available first:

- The timestamp of the first review request.
- Or the timestamp when the Pull Request was opened. A draft isn't considered open.
- Or the timestamp the Pull Request was created.

<Accordion title="Examples">

- A Pull Request that got reviewed while in draft state, without requesting reviews, would use the Pull
  Request creation time.
- A Pull Request that got created in draft, converted to open, and then got reviewed without ever requesting reviews, would use the
  timestamp of when it was converted to open.
- A Pull Request that got created in draft, and requested multiple reviewers, would use the timestamp of the first review request.

</Accordion>

While this may seem overly complex, it's important so that the time elapsed calculation is fair for developers.

## Use cases

- Easily see developer's code reviews in one place. Quickly open the pull requests and go through the comments.
- Spot LGTM stamps in a glance (number of comments vs Pull Request size).
- Coach a developer into becoming a better reviewer.
  - Assess their communication style.
  - Assess the depth of their reviews.
  - Assess review frequency.
