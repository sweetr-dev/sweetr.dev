## Demo

</Frame>

## Size

The pull request size is calculated based on the amount of lines changed.

<PrSize color="#69DB7C" size="Tiny" label="< 20 lines changed." />
<PrSize color="#69DB7C" size="Small" label="20~100 lines changed." />
<PrSize color="#A6A7AB" size="Medium" label="100~250 lines changed." />
<PrSize color="#ff8787" size="Large" label="250~500 lines changed." />
<PrSize color="#ff8787" size="Huge" label="> 500 lines changed." />

Customize how PR size is calculated in your workspace settings.

## Indicators

Each pull request has indicators regarding the time to review, approve and merge.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Review badge">
    <PrBadge color="#a6a7ab" type="no-review" />
    <PrBadge color="#a6a7ab" type="reviewed" />
    <PrBadge color="#a6a7ab" type="approved" />
    <PrBadge color="#C92A2A" type="merged-no-review" />
  </Card>
  <Card title="Merge badge">
    <PrBadge color="#a6a7ab" type="open" />
    <PrBadge color="#a6a7ab" type="merged" />
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The color of the icons also changes depending on the time elapsed for the corresponding event.

<ColorBadge color="#51cf66" label="< 2 hours." />
<ColorBadge color="#a6a7ab" label="2~24 hours." />
<ColorBadge color="#fab005" label="24~48 hours." />
<ColorBadge color="#C92A2A" label="> 48 hours." marginBottom={20} />

<Info>Weekends are not included when calculating time elapsed.</Info>
