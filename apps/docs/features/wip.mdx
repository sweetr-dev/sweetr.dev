## How it works

The Work in Progress page provides a real-time view of all the team's open Pull Requests, grouping it by their status.

This is a focused view of the [Pull Requests](/features/pull-requests) page, and can be used to get a quick overview of the team's work in progress.

## Use cases

- Facilitate daily meetings.
- Identify blocked PRs.
- Identify PRs with a lot of comments that might need attention.
