## How it works

Automations are plug-n-play no-code improvements you can add to your organization in a single click. Think of them as an opinionated easier version of GitHub Actions for specific purposes.

Each automation can improve one or more areas of your engineering organization, we categorize them as:

- Improves tech debt
- Improves failure rate
- Improves security
- Improves cycle time
- Improves compliance
