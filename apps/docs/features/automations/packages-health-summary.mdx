## How it works

Every time a yarn.lock or package-lock.json file is modified on a Pull Request, sweetr.dev adds a comment to the file with a summary of the changes. The summary lists for each updated package:

- Package Name.
- Type (Removed/Downgraded/Updated/Added).
- Previous and New Version.
- Package's minified bundle size (powered by bundlephobia.com).
- Package's health (powered by snyk.com).

## How can this help your team?

Engineers hardly ever review lock files. They are huge and hard to read. This helps them understand how dependencies are being changed on a quick glance.

- **Package health**: Reconsider unmaintained packages that will become tech-debt. Instant access to package's full health analysis on Snyk.
- **Bundle size**: Understand how adding a package will affect the website's bundle size, enabling better performance management.
- **Security awareness**: Instant access to vulnerability reports ensures that security concerns are addressed promptly.
- **Streamlined reviews**: Engineers can quickly understand the impact of changes without manually sifting through large lock files.
- **Understand the dependency tree**: Expose the real cost of adding a package, including sub-dependencies.
